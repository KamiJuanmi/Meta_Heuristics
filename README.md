# Meta_Heuristics

Project for the course of meta-heuristics at Universitetet i Bergen.

The project was about coding some heuristics in order to minimize the cost of transportation of some vessels.

By the time of coding this it's my first time ever programming in python so, it can contain some language mistakes regarding optimization with the memory and speed.

For any question --> juanmiuniversidad@gmail.com
